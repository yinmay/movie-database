### using `create-react-app` to make the basic framework
### create the Movie component and add props on it
### using the `PropTypes` to control the type of each prop
### setup api
* using the `fetch` method to get the api from the movie-database website in `componentDidMount` lifecycle
* using `async` as callback function, by using the `await`, we have to wait for the json is ready
* try and catch is just making sure it does not come out some errors
* `setState` set the movies' states
* using the `map` list the array with ids and output the info into the Movie component
